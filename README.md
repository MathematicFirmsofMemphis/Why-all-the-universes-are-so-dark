# Why-all-the-universes-are-so-dark
A detailed script to make a lense and explains why space is dark. This is because of one massive rock casting a shadow!

This lenses results in infinite field of view with no background. If you see a background it is a trap of an object
Options would be to mine the object for 2^45 eons or fracture it using a 2^965643343436 amount of datacenter space drones or bases over time.

Have AI and RTS bots!

If no lenses can be made just write a (black,black,black) image processor for cpu
//Added how a better description of the darkness is called a shadow image
